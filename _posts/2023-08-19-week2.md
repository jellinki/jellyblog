**Weekend (08.26.2023-08.27.2023):**  
Over the weekend, I had to take the SAT so I unfortunately did not get too far in my program. However, I updated the Jupyter notebook to display a Python tutorial with some code of my sample side projects. I also touched the page up cosmetically so that it looks nice.  

**Day 6 (08.28.2023)**  
Today, I was able to craft a new blog page for this new week. I have to figure out a nice gif for the cover image and a new picture for the thumbnail, and I think I'm going to switch the week 1 thumbnail image with the Jupyter notebook thumbnail image, just so that they match to my liking. Unfortunately, my Link folder is local to my PC, so I'll have to wait until I get home.
