This week, I was able to install WSL: Ubuntu-20.04.  
I was also able to create this blog using a jekyll template! I hope that it will continue to go smoothly.  
I also coded a few side projects in Python. I made a lot of errors on them, so they took me a really long time to finish.  
I've also made my own Github page and joined the class.
