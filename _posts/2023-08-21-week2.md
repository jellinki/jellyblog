I joined Computer Science because, even though I'm planning on majoring in biology-related fields, I feel that having at least some background in computer science is very helpful, especially in today's digital age.  
This year, I hope to be able to gain a lot more experience and knowledge in coding, since I didn't really know anything about it before. I'll keep working hard and trying new things!
